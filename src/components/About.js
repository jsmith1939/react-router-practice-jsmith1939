                    I was born and raised in Indy. I have recently just graduated from Ivy Tech Community College with a Associates of Science degree in Cyber Security. I am excited to be a part of Kenzie Academy because I believe that being with like-minded and talented people will help my grow as a programmer. A fun fact about myself is that I am very creative person. I love to draw, watch anime, and play video games.
